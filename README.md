## Overview
This is the implementation of the method proposed in "Peiquan Li, Changsheng Chen, Yulia Chernyshova, Dmitry Nikolaev, Shunquan Tan, Vladimir Arlazarov, "Disentangling Moiré and Texture: Towards Robust Display-Recapture Detection for Document Images," 2025 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)

## Environment
This code was implemented with Python 3.7 and PyTorch 1.10.1. You can install all the requirements via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

## Train
